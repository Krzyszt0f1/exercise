# isLeapYear

### Description:
This code solves the problem of finding if a given year (as an `integer`) is a leap year (in a Gregorian calendar) or not, it uses the following algorithm to determine it:

```
on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
    except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
        unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
```

More info on the topic can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#Algorithm)

### Additional info:
As per the main [README](../README.md), to run the tests of this project simply execute `npm test` in the root folder.
